    <h2>Site Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Assignment 3 is a continuation of the CSCB20 course website developed in Assignment 2, with the addition of new features implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite, and Flask. This assignment focuses on creating a login system for registered users (students and instructors) to access course materials and functionality specific to their roles.

        The main features of the website include:

        <strong>User Authentication:</strong> Users can register as either students or instructors and log in using their credentials. Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the SQLite database.

        <strong>Homepage Redesign:</strong> The homepage is redesigned to include options for signing in or signing up for new users. It may also showcase course information and university branding.

        <p></p>
        
        <strong>Student Features:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Students can view their current grades for assignments, midterm exams, labs, and final exams.</li>
            <li>They have the option to submit remarking requests for grading disputes.</li>
            <li>A feedback form allows students to provide anonymous feedback to the instructor, with questions tailored to course content and teaching methods.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Instructor Features:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Instructors can view grades of all students enrolled in the course.</li>
            <li>They have access to anonymous feedback submitted by students.</li>
            <li>Instructors can also view remark requests made by students.</li>
            <li>Additionally, they can enter marks for students directly through a form-like interface.</li>
        </ul>

        The website ensures that user-specific content and functionalities are accessible only to authorized users after successful login. It maintains simplicity, clarity, and appeal in design while prioritizing usability and responsiveness.

        Technologies used include Flask for backend development, SQLite for database management, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend design and interactivity, and SQLAlchemy for database manipulation within Flask. The website runs on port 5000 and adheres to relative path names to ensure compatibility across different environments.

        A detailed report outlines the implemented features, any incomplete functionalities, and the distribution of work among team members. The submission package includes a .db file containing predefined users and dummy data for testing, along with the Flask code in app.py and any necessary static files.
